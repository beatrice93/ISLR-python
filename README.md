# Labs from ISLR, but for Python

This project is my attempt at doing statistical learning with scikit-learn and statsmodels.

I am planning to follow (as much as possible) all the labs from the excellent Introduction To Statistical Learning with Applications in R by James, Witten, Hastie and Tibshirani (book page [here](http://faculty.marshall.usc.edu/gareth-james/ISL/index.html), and I'll add the notebooks as I go.
